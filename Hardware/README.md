# Smart Medibox Hardware Setup

This document provides a detailed guide to the hardware setup for the Smart Medibox project, including the components used and their connections to the ESP32 microcontroller.

## Components Used

- **Microcontroller:** ESP32 DevKit or any ESP32 module
- **OLED Display:** SSD1306 (128x64 pixels)
- **Temperature and Humidity Sensor:** DHT22
- **Light Dependent Resistors (LDR):** 2x
- **Push Buttons:** 4x (PB_CANCEL, PB_OK, PB_UP, PB_DOWN)
- **Buzzer:** For audio alerts
- **LED:** For visual alerts
- **Servo Motor:** SG90
- **WiFi Module:** Internal ESP32 WiFi

## Hardware Connections

### ESP32 Pin Connections

#### OLED Display

- **SDA** to pin 21 (or SDA pin on ESP32)
- **SCL** to pin 22 (or SCL pin on ESP32)
- **RST** to pin -1 (or any digital pin, set in code)
- **VCC** to 3.3V
- **GND** to GND

#### DHT22

- **Data pin** to pin 17 (DHTPIN in code)
- **VCC** to 3.3V
- **GND** to GND

#### LDRs

- **Left LDR** to pin 32 (Left_LDR in code)
- **Right LDR** to pin 33 (Right_LDR in code)
- **Both VCC** to 3.3V
- **Both GND** to GND

#### Push Buttons

- **PB_CANCEL** to pin 18
- **PB_OK** to pin 34
- **PB_UP** to pin 35
- **PB_DOWN** to pin 12
- **All buttons GND** to GND
- **All buttons with pull-up resistor** to 3.3V

#### Buzzer

- **Positive** to pin 16 (BUZZER in code)
- **Negative** to GND

#### LED

- **Anode (longer pin)** to pin 5 (LED_1 in code)
- **Cathode (shorter pin)** to GND

#### Servo Motor

- **Signal** to pin 25 (servoPin in code)
- **VCC** to 5V
- **GND** to GND

### Additional Components

- **External Power Supply:** Required for the servo motor, usually 5V

### Adjust Pin Definitions

Ensure the pin definitions in your code match your actual wiring.

## Usage

1. **Power Up:** Connect the ESP32 to power.
2. **Initialization:** The Medibox will initialize and connect to WiFi.
3. **Main Operation:**
   - The OLED will display the main screen.
   - Use the buttons to navigate through menus and set time/alarm settings.
   - Alerts for temperature, humidity, and alarms are displayed on the OLED, LED, and sound buzzer.
   - The servo motor adjusts based on ambient light levels.
