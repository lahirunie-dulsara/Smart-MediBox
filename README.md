# Smart MediBox

The **Smart MediBox** is an embedded systems project designed to provide an intelligent medicine storage solution with features such as time-synced alarm notifications, environmental monitoring, and remote interaction through MQTT and Node-RED.

## Project Overview

This project leverages the ESP32 microcontroller to build a smart medicine box that manages alarms, monitors environmental conditions, and adjusts light exposure. It also integrates with **Node-RED** for real-time data visualization and remote interaction.

## Features

### Core Functionalities
- **Time Synchronization:** Syncs with NTP servers with timezone configuration.
- **Alarm Management:** Create, manage, and disable medication alarms.
- **OLED Display:** Shows time, system status, and alarm notifications.
- **Audible Alerts:** Buzzer activates during alarms; stopped by push buttons.
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Tracks temperature and humidity levels.
- **Light Monitoring:** LDRs measure ambient light intensity.
- **Servo Motor Control:** Adjusts a shaded window based on light intensity and medicine requirements.

### Advanced Functionalities
- **Persistent Storage:** Saves alarms and user preferences to non-volatile memory.
- **User Interface:** Menu-based navigation via OLED and push buttons.
- **Change Detection:** Efficient sensor polling to reduce power usage.
- **Continuous Monitoring:** Always-on sensors with real-time dashboard updates.

## System Architecture

### Modules
- **Hardware Abstraction Layer:** Simplifies interactions with physical components.
- **Sensor Management:** Handles data from DHT (Temp/Humidity) and LDRs.
- **Alarm Management:** Stores and triggers alarms.
- **Time Management:** Handles time sync and local offset.
- **User Interface:** Menu-driven interaction via buttons and OLED.
- **Communication Management:** Publishes/subscribes MQTT topics for remote control and monitoring.
